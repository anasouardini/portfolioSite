# [My Portfolio Site](https://anasouardini.online/)

My personal portfolio web page where I list my skills and project. I finally got to try this cool piece of technology (Astro), it was a wonderful experience to explore numerous new things all within one project.

My design skills are not great, but I think this is the most good-looking UI I've ever made :).
